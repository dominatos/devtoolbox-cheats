# Changelog

## v1.4.15 (2026-06-10)

**Bug fixes & Adjustments:**
- ✅ Fix: FZF search in KDE 5 and older fzf versions. The `--preview-window 'right:60%'` option was passed with an invalid trailing space due to a KDE 5 Javascript escaping bug, and older `fzf` versions rejected the syntax entirely. Replaced across the entire codebase with the universal `--preview-window=right:60%` syntax.

---

## v1.4.14 (2026-06-10)

**Bug fixes & Layout adjustments:**
- ✅ Fix: Zenity and Yad dialogs now correctly display categories and cheatsheets containing ampersands (`&`). Previously, GTK's Pango markup parser would fail on unescaped ampersands, causing items like "Backups & S3" to disappear or create duplicated ghost rows.
- ✅ Fix: Added `VERSION` variable tracking to all scripts and KDE widgets, which is now displayed in the Settings menu.

---

## v1.4.13 (2026-06-10)

**Bug fixes & Layout adjustments:**
- ✅ Fix: On small screens (≤1368×768), the drilldown layout now correctly hides inline categories and only shows the "Browse all cheats" dialog entry point, making it consistent with the standard and zenity layouts.
- ✅ Fix: Changed Argos menu item syntax to use `param1` for passing script paths to `code` and `doublecmd`, preventing breakage when paths contain spaces.
- ✅ Fix: Escaped glob metacharacters (`[`, `]`, `*`, `?`) when searching for cheatsheets by filename, ensuring files containing brackets or wildcards are matched correctly.
- ✅ Fix: Notification "copied to clipboard" now conditionally triggers only if `CLIPBOARD_COPY` is set, with a fallback neutral message when missing.
- ✅ Fix: `ensure_cache` now correctly rebuilds (clears) the cache instead of leaving it stale when all markdown files have been deleted.
- ✅ Fix: `showSettings` now properly expands `\n` characters using `printf '%b'` so that the dialog doesn't display literal backslash-n sequences.
- ✅ Fix: Category cache files are now written atomically using a temporary file and `mv`, preventing partial or corrupted cache files if generation is interrupted.
- ✅ Fix: Category cache filenames are now generated using a collision-free `sha256sum` hash of the category name rather than a lossy alphanumeric normalization, preventing cache collisions between categories like `A+B` and `A/B`.
- ✅ Security: `ARGOS_CAT_STATE` now uses a private per-user directory instead of falling back to `/tmp`, and state files are written atomically using a temporary file to prevent symlink attacks and clobbered files.

---

## v1.4.12 (2026-06-09)

**Development & Alignment:**
- ✅ Synchronized the Argos menu structure in `devtoolbox-cheats.30s-separate-menu-DEV.sh` with the production script: added the `🛠 DevToolbox Functions` submenu, fixed panel button text to "🗒️ Cheatsheets", and removed collapsed/expanded logic so categories are always flat while preserving the drill-down `setCategory` action.

---

## v1.4.11 (2026-06-09)

**Development & Installation:**
- ✅ Created `install-dev.sh`: an interactive Argos script installer allowing users to select between the standard, zenity-list, and drill-down DEV variants, including an option to install all three simultaneously under distinct filenames.
- ✅ Synchronized the Argos menu structure in `devtoolbox-cheats.30s-zenity-cheatslist-DEV.sh` with the production script: added the `🛠 DevToolbox Functions` submenu, fixed panel button text, and removed collapsed/expanded logic so categories are always flat and open the zenity dialog directly.

---

## v1.4.10 (2026-06-08)

**Development & Testing:**
- ✅ Isolate cache files for the DEV script (`devtoolbox-cheats.30s-separate-menu-DEV.sh`). The DEV script now writes to `~/.cache/devtoolbox-cheats-dev.idx` and `~/.cache/devtoolbox-cheats-argos-dev/` to ensure it never interferes with or pollutes the production script's cache.

---

## v1.4.9 (2026-06-08)

**Performance — Cache Fixes (DEV script + production script):**
- ✅ Fix critical bug: `CHEATS_REBUILD=0` was treated as truthy by `[[ -n ... ]]`, causing a full re-index of all 158 cheatsheets on **every** script invocation. Changed to `CHEATS_REBUILD=""` so the cache is correctly used. Fixed in both `devtoolbox-cheats.30s-separate-menu-DEV.sh` and `devtoolbox-cheats.30s.sh`.
- ✅ Add `_CACHE_CHECKED` per-process guard in `ensure_cache()` (DEV script): eliminates redundant `find` mtime scans when multiple action functions call `ensure_cache()` in the same shell invocation (e.g. `standaloneMenu` → `browseAllCheatsFS`).
- ✅ Cache `get_screen_dims()` result in `_SCREEN_DIMS_CACHED` (DEV script): `xdpyinfo`/`xrandr` is now queried at most once per run instead of on every `list_dialog()` and `text_dialog()` call.
- ✅ Cache `base64` flag detection at startup in `_B64ENC_FLAG` (DEV script): eliminates `base64 --help | grep` subprocess pair spawned on every `b64enc()` call (was called once per cheatsheet in Argos render loop, 158×/run).
- ✅ Remove redundant identity `awk` passthrough in `argos_category_lines()` and Argos expanded-mode render loop (DEV script): the second `awk` was reading and re-printing the same TSV unchanged.

---

## v1.4.8 (2026-06-08)

**Codebase & Documentation Alignment:**
- ✅ `README.md`: Updated 'Usage' instructions to accurately reflect the new GNOME Argos `🛠 DevToolbox Functions` submenu introduced in v1.4.4.
- ✅ `README.md`: Updated the 'Other DEs (Dialog Menu)' section to document the inline categories and new buttons added in v1.4.5.
- ✅ Fix: The `CHEAT_VIEWERS` environment variable couldn't be overridden by the user because its value was hardcoded inside the script. This bug is now fixed, and it properly respects custom overrides while defaulting to a much larger list of popular editors: `"code codium antigravity windsurf subl kate kwrite geany gedit mousepad pluma xed notepadqq zenity"`.

---

## v1.4.7 (2026-06-08)

**Installation:**
- ✅ `install.sh`: The GNOME Argos installer now also deploys `devtools.1m.sh` to provide an additional tools menu panel
- ✅ Documentation: Added a note about the new DevTools menu to the Argos section in `README.md`

---

## v1.4.6 (2026-06-08)

**Bug fixes:**
- ✅ Fix: Argos `⚙️ Settings` entry in `🛠 DevToolbox Functions` submenu now shows the Settings info dialog correctly — previously it opened the full `standaloneMenu()` instead
- ✅ Add dedicated `showSettings()` function + `showSettings` dispatch action so the info dialog can be triggered directly from Argos without launching the full navigation menu
- ✅ Fix: `CHEATS_REBUILD=1` → `0` — the debug flag was left hardcoded, causing a full cheatsheet re-index on **every** script invocation; menus are now fast (cache is rebuilt only when `.md` files change)
- ✅ Fix: Argos small-screen layout accidentally nested 'Edit this script' and 'Go to Argos folder' as a submenu under 'Open compact menu'. Removed `--` prefix to render them as top-level items.

---

## v1.4.5 (2026-06-08)

**Dialog menus — Inline Category Listing:**
- ✅ `standaloneMenu()`: categories are now listed inline directly after functional buttons — no extra click needed to browse cheatsheets
- ✅ `compactMenu()`: same inline category listing added
- ✅ Both menus: added `"── Categories ──"` label divider between functional buttons and category list
- ✅ `compactMenu()`: added `⚙️ Settings` button (previously only in `standaloneMenu()`)
- ✅ Argos `🛠 DevToolbox Functions` submenu: added `⚙️ Settings` entry (launches `standaloneMenu`)
- ✅ Clicking a category calls `browseDeep_Cheats()` directly — reduces navigation from 3 clicks to 2
- ✅ `"── Categories ──"` divider is a no-op (re-shows the menu if clicked)
- ✅ `browseAllCheatsFS()` function and `📚 Browse all cheats` menu item are preserved unchanged
- ✅ No impact on GNOME Argos menu layout, KDE widget, or DE detection logic

---

## v1.4.4 (2026-06-08)

**GNOME Argos — Functions Submenu:**
- ✅ Normal-screen layout: moved all 6 functional buttons (Compact Menu, Search, FZF Search, Export, Online Version, GitHub) into a collapsible `🛠 Functions` submenu
- ✅ Functions submenu appears before cheatsheet category groups — reclaims top-level Argos dropdown space for categories
- ✅ Small-screen layout is unchanged (existing behavior preserved)
- ✅ No impact on KDE, XFCE, dialog-based, or terminal DE paths

---

## v1.4.3 (2026-06-06)

**GNOME Argos — Auto-Adaptive Menu Layout:**
- ✅ Fix: categories with submenus were invisible on 1080p screens — GNOME Shell clipped submenus when the dropdown exceeded screen height
- ✅ Add `calc_max_argos_groups()` function — dynamically calculates the safe maximum number of top-level category groups based on screen resolution
- ✅ Collapsed mode: when group count exceeds the screen-safe threshold (e.g. 19 groups on 1080p), all categories are nested under **📂 Browse by Category** with `----` third-level submenu items — ensuring submenus always have room to render
- ✅ Expanded mode: original behavior preserved when screen is large enough (e.g. ≥1440p with current group count)
- ✅ Formula: `(screen_height − 30px) / 28px × 60%` — the 60% factor reserves vertical space for submenu rendering
- ✅ No new external dependencies — reuses existing `get_screen_dims()`
- ✅ No impact on KDE, XFCE, dialog-based, or terminal DE paths

---
